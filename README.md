# thefuck-rs

thefuck-rs is a port of the core APIs from the original [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) CLI, but written in Rust.

Currently, this repository powers [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/)'s [Command Corrections](https://docs.warp.dev/features/editor/command-corrections) feature.
Command Corrections provides auto-correct suggestions on previously run commands to catch typos, forgotten flags, and fix general console errors.
